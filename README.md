A project I build during a hackathon, we were tasked with predicting which pokemon would be where given a dataset. 

The app queries a number of api's for time, weather, location etc and run this info through a linear regression trained on the cvs provided.

You'll have to get your own google api keys for this to work for you. (api_keys.py)
